# CGAN-Model-on-Fashion-MNIST-
This project uses a Conditional GAN (CGAN) to generate grayscale images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset based on class labels. It enables the generation of specific fashion items like shoes or shirts, useful for data augmentation and exploring label-guided image synthesis.
